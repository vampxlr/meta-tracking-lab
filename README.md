## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm i -D autoprefixer postcss tailwindcss
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Meta Pixel Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id_here

# Conversions API Configuration (Future)
FB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
FB_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id_here
```

## CAPI Setup

This lab includes a functional Conversions API (CAPI) implementation for server-side event tracking. The CAPI Test page allows you to send events directly to Meta's Graph API, bypassing browser restrictions and improving tracking reliability.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up CAPI, ensure you have:

- **Meta Pixel** - A Meta Pixel created in Meta Business Manager
- **Access Token** - A System User Access Token with appropriate permissions

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a Meta Pixel**
   
   Navigate to Meta Business Manager > Events Manager > Pixels and create a new pixel for your app.

2. **Generate a System User Access Token**
   
   Create a System User in Meta Business Manager and generate an access token with the following permissions:
   - `ads_management`
   - `ads_read`

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   
   Add the following variables to your `.env.local` file:
   
   ```bash
   # Meta CAPI Configuration
   META_CAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id_here
   META_GRAPH_API_VERSION=v19.0
   META_TEST_EVENT_CODE=your_test_code_here
   ```
   
   - `META_CAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN` (required) - Your System User Access Token
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID` (required) - Your Meta Pixel ID
   - `META_GRAPH_API_VERSION` (optional) - Graph API version (defaults to v19.0)
   - `META_TEST_EVENT_CODE` (optional) - Test event code for development testing

4. **Run the Development Server**
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test CAPI**
   
   Navigate to [`/capi-test`](http://localhost:3000/capi-test) to access the CAPI Test page and send test events.

### Testing CAPI

The CAPI Test page provides an interactive interface for testing server-side event tracking:

- **Send Test Events** - Choose between different event types (ViewContent, AddToCart, Purchase)
- **Mode Selection** - Test both "Broken" and "Fixed" implementations to understand common issues
- **Event Logging** - View real-time event logs with JSON payloads
- **Verification** - Use Meta Events Manager's Test Events tab to verify received events

### Important Notes

- **Security** - Never commit `.env.local` to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.
- **Access Tokens** - Keep your access tokens secure and rotate them periodically.
- **Test Events** - Always use test event codes during development to avoid polluting production data.
- **Broken Mode** - The "Broken" mode is for demonstration purposes only and shows common implementation mistakes.
- **Production** - When moving to production, remove test event codes and ensure proper error handling and retry logic.
