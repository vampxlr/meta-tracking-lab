## 🚀 How to Use This Clean Project

### First Time Here?
1. Read `README.md` for overview
2. Read `.ai-context.md` for architecture
3. Read `AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for patterns
4. Start building!

### Building a New Page?
1. Open `ENHANCED_INTERACTIVE_GUIDE.md`
2. Find your page (pre-written examples included!)
3. Copy template from `app/problems/duplicate-events/page.tsx`
4. Paste examples from guide
5. Customize content
6. Test and verify
7. Takes 30-45 minutes!

### Checking Progress?
1. Open `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md`
2. See what's done (6/17)
3. See what's next (11 pages)
4. Follow priority order

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: What NO LONGER EXISTS

### Do NOT Try to Use These (They're Deleted!)
```typescript
// ❌ DON'T - These files don't exist anymore
import { DemoPanel } from "@/components/demo-panel"
import { EventPlayground } from "@/components/event-playground"
import { pagesRegistry } from "@/content/pages-registry"

// ✅ DO - Use this instead
import { EnhancedEventPlayground } from "@/components/enhanced-event-playground"
```

### Do NOT Reference These (They're Deleted!)
- Any file with "REFACTOR" or "TRANSFORMATION" in the name (except `INTERACTIVE_TRANSFORMATION_COMPLETE.md`)
- `features-implemented/` folder
- `todos/` folder
- `app/[...slug]/` dynamic route
- `pages-registry.ts` file

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
Your project is clean and ready! Next developer or AI model can:
1. Read the 3 core docs (15 minutes)
2. Open the implementation guide
3. Start building pages immediately
4. No confusion, no outdated info

### Building Remaining Pages
Follow this order for maximum impact:
1. Low Match Quality (PII hashing)
2. Purchase Mismatch (revenue tracking)
3. Wrong Parameters (common errors)
4. Missing Event ID (deduplication)
5. CAPI Setup (server config)
6. Continue with remaining 6 pages

**Each page:** 30-45 minutes using pre-written examples!
